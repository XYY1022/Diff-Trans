# Description
In this study, the Diffusion model and Transformer model are combined to solve the problem of insufficient data in flood prediction. The diffusion model is used for data expansion and the Transformer model is used for flood flow prediction. We use the flood prediction data of Wanan Reservoir, Zhexi Reservoir and Pankou Reservoir as the data set to forecast, and the results show that the prediction effect is better than the traditional model in most cases.
